V5 Bloques
---------------
Instructions:


++ Bloques ++

A "letter block" pixelfont.  Lowercase is light;
uppercase is dark. There are some non-letter 
characters scattered in some of the punctuation.
Use sparingly, and tweak spacing for more 
interesting results.


Set on screen at 14pt (or multiple of), with 
antialias off.


---------------
Usage:  This is a free font--you may use 
this and other V5 fonts at will.  It may not 
be sold, altered, or improperly credited,
however.  All I ask is that you kindly inform 
me if you find this font useful, and where
you've used it.

Enjoy,
